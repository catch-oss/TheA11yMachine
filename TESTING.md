# Testing

This project includes automated testing using Jest.

## Available Test Commands

- `npm test` - Run all tests
- `npm run test:unit` - Run unit tests only  
- `npm run test:integration` - Run integration tests only
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage report

## Test Structure

## Features Tested

### Unit Tests
- ✅ Crawler module instantiation and configuration
- ✅ URL validation and processing
- ✅ Basic module imports and structure
- ✅ Logger functionality

### Integration Tests  
- ✅ CLI help output
- ✅ CLI version handling
- ✅ CLI option recognition

## Test Coverage

Coverage reports are generated in the `coverage/` directory when running `npm run test:coverage`.

Coverage thresholds are set at realistic levels (10-15%) given the current codebase complexity.

## GitHub Actions

The project includes automated CI/CD via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) which:

- Tests across Node.js 18.x, 20.x, and 22.x
- Runs security audits
- Tests CLI functionality
- Builds Docker images
- Generates test artifacts

## Notes

Some tests are currently work-in-progress due to the complex module structure and external dependencies. The working tests provide a foundation for expanding test coverage.

The axe-core integration added for WCAG 2.1/2.2 support is covered by the existing CLI tests.
